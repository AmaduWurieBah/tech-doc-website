            <h3>Description of Flex Box Module</h3>

            <p>The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities. This article gives an outline of the main features of flexbox, which we will be exploring in more detail in the rest of these guides.
            When we describe flexbox as being one dimensional we are describing the fact that flexbox deals with layout in one dimension at a time â€” either as a row or as a column. This can be contrasted with the two-dimensional model of CSS Grid Layout, which controls columns and rows together.</p>

            <h3>Description of Box Modle Module</h3>

            <p>This specification describes the margin and padding properties, which create spacing in and around a CSS box.CSS is a language for describing the rendering of structured documents (such as HTML and XML) on screen, on paper, etc. </p>

            <h3>Discription of HTML 5 Tags</h3>

            <p>If you know a little about HTML you will know that HTML tags are (mostly) used to format content - these tags tell the browser how to display the content on the page. They give no indication as to what type of content they contain or what role that content plays in the page. Semantic HTML5 addresses this shortcoming by defining specific tags to indicate clearly what role is played by the content those tags contain.  That explicit information helps robots/crawlers like Google and Bing to better understand which content is important, which is a subsidiary, which is for navigation, and so on. By adding semantic HTML tags to your pages, you provide additional information that helps Google and Bing understand the roles and relative importance of the different parts of your page.</p>

            <h1>CSS Flexbox Layout Module</h1>
            <h2>Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Block, for sections in a webpage</li>
                <li>Inline, for text</li>
                <li>Table, for two-dimensional table data</li>
                <li>Positioned, for explicit position of an element</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.</p>
            <h1>The flex container properties are:</h1>

            <h1>Sematic HTML Five Tags</h1>
            <p>Semantic HTML elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. Elements such as <header>, <footer> and <article> are all considered semantic because they accurately describe the purpose of the element and the type of content that is inside them.</p>

                    <li>Article</li>

            <h3>The flex-direction Property</h3>
            <p>The flex-direction property is a sub-property of the Flexible Box Layout module. It establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Reminder: the main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out</p>

            <h3>flex-wrap</h3>
            <p>The flex-wrap property is a sub-property of the Flexible Box Layout module. It defines whether the flex items are forced in a single line or can be flowed into multiple lines. If set to multiple lines, it also defines the cross-axis which determines the direction new lines are stacked in.</p>

            <h3>Flex-flow</h3>
            <p>The flex-flow property is a sub-property of the Flexible Box Layout module. It is a shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap</p>

            <h3>Justify-Content</h3>
            <p>The justify-content property is a sub-property of the Flexible Box Layout module. It defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size.</p>

            <h3>Align-Item</h3>
            <p>The align-items property defines the default behavior for how items are laid out along the cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis). Imagine a horizontal flexbox layout. That horizontal flow is the main axis, so align-items is the alignment opposite that, on the vertical axis</p>

            <h3>Align-Content</h3>
            <p>It defines how each line is aligned within a flexbox/grid container. It only applies if flex-wrap: wrap is present, and if there are multiple lines of flexbox/grid items. default align-content: stretch; Each line will stretch to fill the remaining space.</p>

            <h3>Order</h3>
            <p>The first flex item in the code does not have to appear as the first item in the layout. The order value must be a number, default value is 0.</p>

            <h3>Flex-grow</h3>
            <p>The flex-grow property is a sub-property of the Flexible Box Layout module. It defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.</p>

            <h3>Flex-shrink</h3>
            <p>The flex-grow property is a sub-property of the Flexible Box Layout module. It defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.</p>

            <h3>Flex-basis</h3>
           <p>The flex-grow property is a sub-property of the Flexible Box Layout module. It defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.</p>

           <h3>Flex</h3>
         	<p>The flex property is a shorthand property for the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties.</p>

            <h3>Align-self</h3>
            <p>The align-self CSS property overrides a grid or flex item's align-items value. In Grid, it aligns the item inside the grid area. In Flexbox, it aligns the item on the cross axis.</p>
